	So types to combine selectors are:
	1. Group selectors-> selector1, selector2(it selects both the selectors and apply changes to both of them).
	2. Child slectors-> parent > child (make changes in the child.The child must be direct descendant of parent.)
	3. Descendant selectors-> selector1 space selector2 (selector2 can be any descendant of slector1.)
	4. Chaining selectors-> selectorselector(remember to not put spaces. Applied where all selectors are true.Always choose the element selector first.It selects the specific element.)
	5. We can also combine these different types of selectors eg. selector selectorselector
