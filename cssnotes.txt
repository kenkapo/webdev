There are 3 types of css->
1.Inline ->targets single element
2.Internal ->targets single webpage
3.External ->targets a website

Types of selectors->
1.Element selector
2.Class selector
3.Id selector

difference between class and id selector->While an ID is specific to a single element, classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website.
4.Attribute selector eg: p[draggable]
                         {
                                color:red;
                            }
5.Universal selector


CSS cascading:
THE CSS CASCADING PRIORITY IN INCREASING ORDER->
1.Position->the lower in the file,the better.
2.Specificity-> id > attribute > class > element selector
3.Type-> inline > internal > external
4.Importance-> usage of !important
